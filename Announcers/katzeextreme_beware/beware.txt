this announcer is based on an older version of katzeextreme.
i re-did some groups according to watching ddr videos, and cs jp,
i also had to add 2 missing sounds.
i used mp3gain to make all mp3's 3 db less loud (0.7 times the original volume),
which makes it exactly like ddr, compared to the music. 
i re-encoded some 320 kbps mp3s to make them smaller

changed groups:

evaluation aaa-e
evaluation final aaa-e removed
evaluation final added (SM patch because in extreme, all grades have the same announcers. this saves about 4 MB)
